### TabCode for web pages

#### Purpose
The problem: You want to display lute or historical guitar tablature in a webpage.

The solution: Download the code for this project and try out the example files. You need to understand how HTML works (and some basic understanding of Javascript won't hurt), but it should be possible to display tablature by just copying and pasting the example files.
